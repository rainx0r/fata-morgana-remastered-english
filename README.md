# fata-morgana-remastered-english
English patch for The House in Fata Morgana Remastered. Based on the PS4 version of "The House in Fata Morgana Dreams of the Revenants Edition", re-enabling disabled english files that already exist in the game, as well a tiny bit of original work.

Everything in the game including scripts, images and menus is translated based on the official translation of the game by MangaGamer. You can think of this patch as a port of that translation to the Remastered version if the game if you will.

The game can be obtained [here](https://www.animategames.jp/home/detail/30082), they seem to accept western cards (or at least they did mine) so long as you have a Japanese IP (you can use a VPN). Please buy it to support Novectacle. Likewise please buy the official HD localized version (PS4 or PS Vita).

## Install
1. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/evangelos-ch/fata-morgana-remastered-english/releases).
2. Unzip its contents into the root of the install directory for The House in Fata Morgana Remastered and accept to overwrite existing files when asked.

The game should now be fully in English. You can change the language between Japanese and English in the Config from the main menu.
